# SQA_HeaalthConnect

## Software Quality Assurance - CEN 4930

This program is a software system that the team will be using for Software Quality Assurance class. 
The program is not originally developed by the team members, but will be reworked during the duration of the SQA course 
in the Spring 2021 semester at Florida Gulf Coast University. 

## Documentation 

### Deliverable 1

During the first deliverable for this project, the team went over any aspects of the softwares documentation that we thought were concerning. 
The team also reviewed the "requirements" that were not clearly identifiable in the document and specified what was wrong with those requirements. 
After looking over the document the team made a list of our own requirements for the system, both functional and non-functional.
